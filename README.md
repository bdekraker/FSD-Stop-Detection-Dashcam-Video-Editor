# FSD-Stop-Detection-Dashcam-Video-Editor
Auto detection of stop / start in driving videos. This application is designed to help users process dashcam footage where the speedometer is visible and automatically detect "boring parts" of the videoâ€”those where the car is stationary, such as at stoplights.
